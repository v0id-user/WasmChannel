# Tell GitHub Linguist to properly count Rust code
# Even though most of the project is written in TypeScript (frontend/backend),
# Rust plays a central role in handling low-level binary protocols, compression, and safety via WebAssembly.
# This ensures the language breakdown reflects actual system architecture importance — not just file size.

*.rs linguist-detectable=true

# These are still counted hidden files — we’re just clarifying Rust's presence
*.ts linguist-detectable=false
*.tsx linguist-detectable=false
*.js linguist-detectable=false
